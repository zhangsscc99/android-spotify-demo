## Getting Started
- Clone this repo:
```sh
https://github.com/zhangsscc99/android-spotify-demo.git
```
- Open the project in Android Studio
- Make sure to have `buildToolsVersion "26.0.2"`

## Installing Spotify Android SDK
You can follow the [Spotify Android SDK Tutorial](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/spotify-android-sdk/tutorial/) to start the set up.

### Quick step
- Download the [Spotify Android playback library zip](https://github.com/spotify/android-sdk/) and [Spotify Android auth library zip](https://github.com/spotify/android-auth/) from GitHub and unzip them.
- In a file explorer (not Android Studio), drag the unzipped spotify-auth-version.aar and spotify-player-version.aar files into the /app/libs directory in your projectâ€™s root directory.
- Playback library can be found when you unzip the zipfile. And simply copy this .aar into app/libs
- Auth library needs some more steps.

### Build .aar for auth library
- Download and unzip
- Remove the auth-sample directory since it is not needed to create .aar file
- In the `\android-auth-1.0\settings.gradle` file, include `':app'`
- Create `\android-auth-1.0\local.properties` and add `sdk.dir=/Users/%YOUR_PC_USERNAME%/Library/Android/sdk` for path to the Android SDK
- Run `./gradlew build` and grab an artifact from `auth-lib/build/outputs/aar/`.

## Generate SHA1
This step is needed for registering application fingerprint
```sh
echo -n password | shasum -a 1 | awk '{print $1}'
```

## Get data from Spotify Web API
- [Spotify Web API for Android](https://github.com/kaaes/spotify-web-api-android)
